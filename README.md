# IOTAzureRouting

This project demonstrates how to calculate distance of a route of a vehicle using IoT messages to Azure services using custom rules. It includes Python scripts and JSON configurations to simulate device telemetry and define message routing paths within Azure IoT Hub.

## Features
- Simulates IoT device telemetry using Python.
- Defines custom routing rules for Azure IoT Hub.
- Includes sample JSON configurations for routing.
- Provides a sample report documenting the project.

## Usage
1. Setup Azure and configure your Azure IoT Hub connection string in connectionCode.py.
2. Run the Python script to simulate telemetry:
```bash
   python connectionCode.py
```
3. Review the routing rules in route1.json and the output in finalOutput.json.
